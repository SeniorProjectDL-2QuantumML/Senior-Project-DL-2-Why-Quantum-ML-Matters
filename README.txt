Abstract: 
In the field of Quantum Machine Learning, there have been many approaches to achieve the task of classification. One prominent avenue is Quantum Neural Networks (QNN). This project will focus on exploring the significance of Grover’s Algorithm within the context of Quantum Neural Networks. Research will be conducted on Grover’s Algorithm to investigate potential enhancements to the capabilities of QNNs. In addition, practical experimentation and further analysis will be done through the use of IBM’s Quantum Composer.
